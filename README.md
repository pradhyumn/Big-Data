# DSGA1004 - BIG DATA

This repository contains the code for implementing big data operations in the Big Data Course at NYU Center for Data Science. A brief description of the labs is as follows:

## Lab 1: SQLite
### Goal of this exercise:
In this exercise, we will write queries to understand the concepts of relational databases and SQL, and write Python scripts to execute those queries.	


## Lab2: MapReduce and Hadoop
### Goal of this exercise:
In this lab, we will be implementing map-reduce jobs using `mrjob`, which is a Python interface to Hadoop.

## Lab3: Spark on Dataproc
### Goal of this exercise:
#### Part 1: 
In this part, we will be using Spark to analyze data on the Dataproc Cluster.
#### Part 2:
In this part of the assignment, we will be comparing the speed of Spark queries against DataFrames backed by either CSV or Parquet file stores, and optimizing the storage to speed up queries.

## Lab4: Dask and Jupyter on NYU Greene cluster (or any HPC cluster):
### Goal of this exercise:
In this part, we will use Dask DataFrames to process a large collection of climate data.
